abstract={  We use a randomised experiment to evaluate Turkey's vocational training programmes for the unemployed. A detailed follow-up survey of a large sample with low attrition enables precise estimation of treatment impacts and their heterogeneity. The average impact of training on employment is positive but close to zero and statistically insignificant, which is much lower than programme officials and applicants expected. Over the first year, training had statistically significant effects on the quality of employment and these positive impacts are stronger when training is offered by private providers. However, administrative data show that after three years these effects have also dissipated. [web URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12211/full]},
